## Polymorphism

Two Types

1. Overloading
2. Overriding

-----------------

* How Overriding works?
* Overriding only works in this case

```java
Shapes circle=new Circle();

```

Here the Reference variable is of a parent or Superclass type,
and the object is of child class type.Otherwise, it's just simple
calling its own method nothing else.

```java
Parent obj=new Child();

```

* Hence, which method will be called depends on the child class
  and this is Known as "Upcasting"

### Dynamic Method Dispatch
