Parent and Child Class are joined using extends keyword.

```java

Box box = new BoxWeight(2,3,4,5);

```

< Here is the Most Important Thing >

It actually depends on the Reference variable that which type
instance variable and method can be accessed. 

eg: Although here we had made an Object of BoxWeight Type
but because the Reference variable is of a Box type, 
that's why it can only access l,w,h but not weight variable.
