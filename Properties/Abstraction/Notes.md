## Abstraction

Hiding Unnecessary details and Showing important and valuable details.


*  In a simple way, "Abstraction" is more like to solve a Design Level issue 
while "Encapsulation" is more like to solve an implementation level issue.

* e.g. : For example, we are creating an ArrayList<>() class Now to 
make it more robust and Solid we should create some methods to access the
class. Now how the addAll() or remove() method to access or do something with
the class. This is Abstraction 

But How we achieve this abstraction in the implementation part this is 
"Encapsulation."
